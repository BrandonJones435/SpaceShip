OVERVIEW:

This is a program that tests for the possibility of a theoretical spaceship blowing up based on 
txt files of sample that are read by the GridMonitor class and tested by the GridMonitorTest driver 
class. Based on the the data read and tested a toString() method will be enacted that tells us which 
cells in our spaceship are at risk of blowing up. 

INCLUDED FILES:

GridMontor.java - source file
GrideMonitorInterface - source file
GridMonitorTest.java - source file and driver class
README - This file 

BUILDING AND RUNNING: 

Once you are in the directory that holds all of the source files run the following commands in the terminal. 

*This will compile the driver program.
$ javac GridMonitorTest.java

*This will execute the driver program.
$ java GridMonitorTest

You will see the results of the tests in the consule. 

PROGRAM DESIGN: 

The GridMonitor class implements the GridMonitor Interface which gives a set of methods for the GridMonitor
class to use that will be compatible with the GridMonitorTest driver class.
